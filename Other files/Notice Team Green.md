# Notice for Team Green

Hey Team, 

I thought it would be good to use github to communicate more with our operations so it can serve the purpose of evidence later on for auditing.

I will make up a 'Notes' to store all our notes from every class. Also a 'Tasks' branch for us to see who's allocated what with due dates. Feel free to add input to them.  Any issues can be put into issues.


Thanks team appreciate your time and input.

Woody 
Team Coordinator
