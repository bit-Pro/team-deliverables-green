**Workshop Schedules.**<br>


As a class we went over the workshops that were on offer.  There were 12 in total but only 7 are allocated to the specified dates. As teams, we prioritised from most to least workshops we wanted to do then compared and worked out a system for overall class decisions on which ones to finalise as class workshops. <br>
(Note:  Those present made an overall decision for their team).
We will go over what workshops were chosen in our team meeting (TBC for Tuesday 21 March 2017)
