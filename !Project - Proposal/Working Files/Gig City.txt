Community Fund:
As part of the prize for winning the Gigatown competition Dunedin was given $500,000 from Chorus to assist organisations in the community to create initiatives that showcase how Ultra-Fast Broadband (UFB) technologies can contribute to social good of our city. It?s available for community innovators exploring the use of Fibre aiming to enhance the opportunities in Dunedin.

They are looking for the following characteristics:

* Gigabit technology projects that are innovative and will add value to the community, (please note that funding is not available for the general day to day running costs of an organisation).
* Projects that have measurable impact and demonstrate how emerging technologies are relevant in people?s everyday lives.
* Initiatives that are of direct benefit to Dunedin City.
* Project concepts that are easily able to be picked up by other organisations.
* Projects that can be reasonably expected to be delivered within 12 months.

The Fund is structured as a grant, community groups can apply for funding during any given funding round. You?re required to provide some Legal Status information when you apply for funding for example that you are associated with or a recognised Charitable Trust. The Applications will be judged by a judging panel. Only one application per organisation will be considered per round.
