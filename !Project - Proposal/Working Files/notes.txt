The department of Internal Affairs has a Translation service which states that ?We provide professional translation and other language services including quality assessment, typesetting, transcription and cultural advice to businesses, central and local government and private individuals.
Whether you're applying for Immigration or Citizenship, need to communicate information to non-English speaking communities in NZ or around the world, or need documents translated for legal, employment or travel purposes? we'll be able to help you.? 
This sounds like it could be an avenue to look up.
Another option I looked at was Kiwi Translation.co. who claim ?Kiwi Translation provides certified translations in all major world languages. Our translations are accepted by Immigration New Zealand, NZQA, The Citizenship Office and MPI. Our service is nationwide, so we can deliver your translation to you wherever you are in New Zealand. Kiwi Translation also provides electronic versions of translations for online visa applications.? This seems more broad and less specific, though it is a third option.
As to website design, as we already know, a clean concise design would suit, as we learnt with the last project.
The Red Cross has a Pathway Settlement program which aids introducing families to their new home and aiding their transition to Kiwi life as smooth as possible. They have 120 trained staff and 600 volunteers.
The Red Cross also has a Pathways to Employment program. This is to help plan a pathway to employment and education with career goals, ultimately being able to find work. The basics are all covered, Career goals, assessing skills including English, Assistance with CV?s and cover letters and aiding in making appointments and getting interviews along with coaching.
Donating goods can also help aid with the effort and volunteers are always welcome as well.
