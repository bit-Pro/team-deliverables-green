-10am: Blue team given a telling off from Elise because they didn?t have an agenda for the Team Meeting ready.
-10.05am: Michael setting up new section in our GitHub repo for the latest task to put Gig City stuff in etc.
- Lissy absent (as well as Tim) but both were supposedly seen on the premises between 9 and 9.30am according to other class members.
-10.09am team meetings started, adjourned 10.30am Notes should be up on GitHub from Blue-Team by Callam.
-10.40am Funding information pushed to GitHub.
-10.42am discussing and briefing with Michael.
-10.45am note by Elise on whiteboard: ?By the end of class: Show me your formal plan for how you are going to be ready for Wednesday. (It needs to be online too)?.
-11.01am we are thinking of going website way. Needs interactivity, maybe a chat section. Unlikely but could have video-chat too? Maybe an RSS Newsfeed for New Zealand News (but could also incorporate news from their home country). No sign up required, easy to use, works with individuals, eye catching, not ugly. Links or contact info for crisis emergencies, stuff like hospital, doctors, cops etc. A map, maybe some translations.
-11.06am discussing if App could be the way to go.
-11.21am decided against app
-11.21am have run out of ideas.
-11.24am deciding on how we will be ready for Wednesday. Gig City funding information done, decided on website idea. Will need to discuss with team in Slack. Upload this file to GitHub as well as Slack for Woody.
11.27am Come up with a Formal Plan. We have several options, needed to be researched, correlated together and shoved on GitHub. Should discuss and confirm in Slack. Correlate questions and solutions
-11.33am Nora will be coming on Wednesday and we can ask questions.
